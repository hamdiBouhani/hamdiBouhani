Recently I started looking into functional programming and that's how i got introduced to Clojure [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=clojure)](https://skillicons.dev) :
[in this repo you will find all the projects or scripts that I implemented to learn and get familiar with Clojure](https://github.com/hamdiBouhani/clojure-workspace)
